# immajung ?

There is a mass of clothing in every store, but no brand is trying to appeal to us, ”nerds”. However, that is the niche that I personally miss. The current selection is limited to merchandise from the big tech companies, which simply print their logo on a simple T-shirt. That is why immajung has decided to satisfy this need. 

From now on we will post to immajung and start our blog, [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/immajung.clo/) and more. We are trying to make the it solutions by ourself to learn more and evolve with the brand.



And it's not only about our current tech problems, but also about the technologies we use for our blog and shop. We want to try to explain the purpose of the techs and the reason to use or avoid them. 



From now on it is no longer just a WhatsApp group with four participants! The live going of our blog is the start to be a professional (uncle bob!). This is where our adventure begins. We see ourselves as a start-up and because startupping is in fashion right now, so we decided to unite the tech industry and fashion. Why immajung? For this I make a short detour into the past.

I did my Bachelor degree with the rest of immajung in [Hildesheim](https://www.uni-hildesheim.de/). As a result I started to work and the others are just finishing their master's degree. We have already started projects several times, but so far we have been unsuccessful (the spirit was missing). It failed because time and motivation were lacking. 



Okay, there was a success. We have realized that we want to work/live the same way in the future. Meet and "work" together. The work in this team feels like a meeting among friends and that's why it's so fun. We do not want to make our career according to the current yardstick. Going to school. Doing good school. Going to job. Doing good job. Of course, being successful is also exciting and can be fun. However, one always has to subordinate oneself to someone.



Okay, but why immajung? During our studies we all slowly realized that the simple life from school is over. Suddenly there are more important things we're not up to. Examinations and housework determine our lives and that is annoying! We have no desire for this feeling and want the feeling of the past back. No adult problems will determine our life. We will takeover again and get the feeling of the past back. Of course we are not stupid and we realize that we cannot escape the rent through our feeling. But wouldn't it be nice if you could pay your rent with something that is just fun?

Okay let’s focus again. What is our goal? First of all: We are not designers. We tried. We also tried to get some professional help, but it ended with many misunderstandings. We can program and know how to use all tools of a designer. So we are trying our first product with a simple design like “hello world”.

Above all, we know about IT and want to show exactly these topics on our clothes. IT always seems to be so abstract and impossible to understand. It is not impossible to illustrate an IT concept on a picture and simply represent terms. Of course we won’t explain everything through some sketches on a shirt. Nevertheless, you have heard some terms before and it also looks original. Dope!

Maybe we'll get you to google a topic sometime. Or we take you to our blog, where we will also explain some topics.

However we will drop our next post soon and we are excited to see your reaction to our first designs!
