# Why Hello World ?

Our second blog post explains the reasons behind our decision to choose “Hello World” as a first design. And even as a first philosophy.

"[Hello World](http://helloworldcollection.de/)" is actually a very small application. It have been created first in 1974 by the Canadian computer scientist Brian Kernighan. The hype about these lines of code (called LOCs by the way) began in 1978, when the book "[The C Programming Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language)" by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie was published. This was the starting shot for pretty much every first line of code.

These lines have brought programming and computer science closer to the average person and had an huge impact on the technology scene at this time.

Now we want to touch the coders of you. Try to remember the beginning of your coding life. 
How much pain did you endure to install your first language. And how much time did you need to get it run with your first IDE (Integrated Development Environment).

In our first year at university we didn’t know much about computer science. Of course we did some jailbreaking and tried to play expensive games for free. Because of that we thought that we have a talent for tech stuff. But after installing our first IDE "[Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/)" and "[Java](https://java.com/)" 7, we had to realize our very small knowledge.

So after spending many hours to get everything running, we could finally launch our “Hello World” application.

At this moment we all thought “what are we actually doing here?”. What does this code actually mean? Our younger naive selfs tried to simply start the program and after fixing the last compile errors we saw the output “Hello World”.

This simple output "Hello World" made our hearts beat faster. It was the first program we wrote and launched. Although it only displayed “Hello World” (in the console).
At that moment it felt like we were starting the next big technology company tomorrow or hacking the world in an instant. 
This happened to every one of us in our programming life. Surely we are not the only ones in this world and everybody knows this adrenaline when some piece of code is finally working.
As simple as “Hello World” is now as important it was for our future. And still is when we are trying to learn something new.
It unleashed a passion for computer science that we still have today.

After we had determined the topic for our first piece, we started to work out the sweater.
That took a very long time I can tell you. We tried to visualize so many ideas but everything was total nonsense, so we had to start every day from scratch.

After some designs we realized that we need some professional help. We hired a designer to realize our thoughts about “Hello World”. It was pretty dope (thank you Sarah Maffeis). 
But we quickly realized that we didn't want to go down this path because it didn’t reflect us and our idea. So we took care of it ourselves.
Even if it’s not impressing anyone. We are working hard and we will get better!

We illustrated from morning to evening together and redesigned everything over and over again. After a long coding session, one of us jumped up screaming he have an idea. 
This was our start to illustrate same as we learn a programming language.
After all, it was a pure coincidence for us, like so often in programming.

It was clean, simple but striking. A simple world with the writing "<HELLO WORLD>" above it. That was it! This simple designed motive corresponded above all to our idea of Immajung. A motive kept simple, with a meaning and tradition! A motive that we all recognize and understand together.

30 years later, after "Hello World" had shaped the technology scene, we want to honour this ongoing hype about the code with a streetwear sweater from [immajung](www.immajung.com)!
