# Why Hello World ?

In this blog entry we would like to explain to you why and how we chose the theme "Hello World" for our first piece.

The myth "[Hello World](http://helloworldcollection.de/)" itself has been known since 1974 by the Canadian computer scientist Brian Kernighan. The hype about these lines of code did not begin until 1978, when the book "[The C Programming Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language)" by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie was published. This was the starting shot for pretty much every first line of code of a programmer. These lines have brought programming and computer science closer to many people and have had an impact on the technology scene to this day. Many who read this blog entry probably have a technical background. So I want you to remember a short moment back how your beginnings in programming were. What effort did the installation of the language and the required configuration take and what content did your first program have?

Since we were only interested in technology from a certain age, we had only little previous knowledge, so that installing, configuring and finally getting the program to work was not really easy. So after we installed the IDE "[Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/)" and [Java](https://java.com/), and it took unusually long, we typed our first lines of code into the computer.

At this moment we all thought “what are we actually doing here?”. What does this code actually mean? Naive as we were, we pressed the start button. After it took us hours to get everything to work, as well as several syntax errors, the program started and brought out the words "Hello World".

These simple lines, with the output "Hello World" made our hearts beat faster. It was the first program we wrote. Although it just displayed “Hello World”, at that moment it felt like we starting the next big technology company tomorrow or hacking the world. This story happened 100% to each one of us. Surely we are not the only ones in this world where this small piece of code created such euphoria. As simple as these lines of code may seem to us today, they had a great effect on the future. It unleashed a passion for computer science that we still have today.

After we had determined the topic for our first piece, we started to work out the sweater. That took a damn long time I can tell you. We tried to visualize so many ideas, but everything was total nonsense, so we rejected them.

After being overwhelmed at first, we decided to commission designers to create designs that would fit the theme of "Hello World". We wanted to make it pretty easy for ourselves. But we quickly realized that we didn't want to go down this path, because it doesn't reflected us and our idea in any way. So we took care of it ourselves. We illustrated from morning to evening together and over a longer period of time, it resembled a coding session, until one of us jumped up screaming, "It works". Animals, globes, people and much more were illustrated, but everything looked to us as if we didn't even want to carry them ourselves.

After all, it was pure coincidence for us, like so often in programming. It was clean, simple but striking. A simple world with the writing "<HELLO WORLD>" above it. That was it! This simple designed motive corresponded above all to our idea of Immajung. A motif kept simple, with a meaning and tradition! A motif that we all recognize and understand together.

30 years later, after "Hello World" had shaped the technology scene, we want to honour this ongoing hype about the code with a streetwear sweater from [immajung](www.immajung.com).
